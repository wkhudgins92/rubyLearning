Written by Micky Braun and Willy Braun
Time sure flies when youre young and on a roll
You think youre never growing old
Til that faithful day when it all slips away
And youre waiting for your future to unfold

Chorus:
If I could only see you, I might not ever leave you
Louisiana baby
If I could only let you know I never wanna let you go
Louisiana baby
The wheels keep turnin and Im not done learnin
Im headin down to New Orleans today
Are you still down there? Do you even care?
If I get the chance this time, Im gonna stay

Chorus

I searched high and low amongst purple, green, and gold
And down on Bourbon it was wall to wall
But you were nowhere to be found
Better luck next time around
I guess its not a small world after all

Chorus
