This program is an abbreviated recode of the LickAnalyzer program which
I developed in early 2013 for the Texas Lutheran University
Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory.

The lab had a transducer which was attached to a mock sipper tube.
Rats would lick the mock sipper tube and the transducer would
record the force of their lick. The researchers theorized that the
force of a rat's lick was a measure of the palatability, as perceived
by the rat, of substances administered via the mock sipper tube.

Each experimental trial generated a file with approximately
2400 data points. 17 rats were used in the experiment.
Each rat underwent 20 trials yielding about
816000 data points spread across 340 files.

The original LickAnalyzer was implemented in Java and in conjunction with
the find command would analyze all data files. The LickAnalyzer would
calculate the mean, mode, median, and sum of each trial. In
addition, the LickAnalyzer would calculate the top ten highest force values.
In conjunction with the find command, the LickAnalyzer would store all the
aforementioned data in a .csv file.

This program is not designed to be used in conjunction with the find command
in order to generate a .csv file in the same way the
original LickAnalyzer did because it does not parse trial information from
the file name. However, given a data file, it will calculate
the mean, mode, median, sum, and the ten largest values and output that information
in .csv format.

The program found in the normal directory has not been optimized to limit memory
usage. Currently, the one in memory directory has not been either; however, I plan
on going back and optimizing the program in memory to limit memory usage.

Note: assumes input file is in correct format.
