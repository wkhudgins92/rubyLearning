This program is an abbreviated recode of the LickAnalyzer program which
I developed in early 2013 for the Texas Lutheran University
Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory.

The lab had a transducer which was attached to a mock sipper tube.
Rats would lick the mock sipper tube and the transducer would
record the force of their lick. The researchers theorized that the
force of a rat's lick was a measure of the palatability, as perceived
by the rat, of substances administered via the mock sipper tube.

Each experimental trial generated a file with approximately
2400 data points. 17 rats were used in the experiment.
Each rat underwent 20 trials yielding about
816000 data points spread across 340 files.

The original LickAnalyzer was implemented in Java and in conjunction with
the find command would analyze all data files. The LickAnalyzer would
calculate the mean, mode, median, and sum of each trial. In
addition, the LickAnalyzer would calculate the top ten highest force values.
In conjunction with the find command, the LickAnalyzer would store all the
aforementioned data in a .csv file.

This program is not designed to be used in conjunction with the find command
in order to generate a .csv file. However, given a data file, it will calculate
the mean, mode, median, sum, and mean of the ten largest values.

The program found in the memory directory was optimized to minimize memory usage
and the one in the normal directory was not optimized to minimize memory usage.
