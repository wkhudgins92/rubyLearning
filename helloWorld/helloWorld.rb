puts 'I am learning Ruby, here are some notes on it:'
puts ''
puts 'Ruby is dynamically typed language with a strong type system.'
puts 'PHP\'s null is Ruby\'s nil and true and false are the same.'
puts 'Everything is an obect...there are no primative types.'
puts 'Like Haskell, parens are optional in method calls.'
puts 'Because everything is a nobject, all variables are references.'
puts 'Unlike Java or PHP, there are no abstract classes or interfaces.j'
puts 'Unlike PHP, hashes and arrays are not interchangeable.'
puts '0, array(), and "" are true and false and nil are false.'
puts 'Almost everything is a method call.'
puts 'Like Java, Ruby has a garbage collector.'
puts 'There are public, private, and protected methods.'
puts 'rdoc is similar to javadoc.'
puts 'Whereas java uses import and php uses include or require_once, Ruby uses require.'
puts 'All object attributes are private.'
puts 'Because variables are references, they don\'t have a type associated with them.'
puts 'While poessessing a strong type system, declarations aren\'t needed because the type system is still dynamic.'
puts 'Constructors are named initialize.'
puts '== tests equivalance and equals?() tests identity.'
puts 'Unlike Java, strings are mutable.'
puts 'chars are one-letter strings.'
